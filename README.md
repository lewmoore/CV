## Who am I?

I am a Full Stack developer and Makers Academy Fellow with a curiosity and passion for technology that drives me to always be exploring new things. My goal is to joing a technology driven company that adheres to modern Software Engineering practices, including TDD, XP and DevOps, where I can make a difference.

I take immense pride in what I do and I thrive within innovative environments where creativity is encouraged. My aim is to join a company that understands the value of technology where I can help deliver clean, well-crafted code.

What I enjoy the most about Software Engineering is the ability to be able to enter the industry regardless of your background. This makes programming such a diverse industry to be a part of and allows me to both meet and work with a huge range of individuals that share the same passion as me.


## Skills

#### Collaboration & Team Work
Throughout my career, I have developed team working skills and realised the importance of collaboration within teams. Since joining Makers Academy, I have taken an interest in Extreme Programming and the principles associated with it. 

During my time at eSynergy Solutions, I was part of a Digital Transformation delivery team where I was responsible for delivering Full Stack Developers and DevOps Engineers to a variety of technology companies. I had to collaborate with my peers to ensure that all of our roles where delivered to on time without sacrificing on quality. We held daily stand ups to ensure all team members had visibility on the days work, and we had weekly retros in odrder to keep up to date with our previously set time frames.

#### Proactive
I am a very proactive person and I am familiar with using my initiative to complete tasks and improve processes. 
Whilst working at Sapient Razorfish, I was responsible for the delivery of the companies entire DevOps function. Before my joining, the company had no existing DevOps team and it was still very new to the company. I was brought in to help set up the hiring of this function and create quarterly plans of the delivery of DevOps Engineers, from Junior engineers to Senior Managers.

I created hiring plans for this initiatve and set up Kanban boards and Trello boards for each role that was open. Tracked the status of each application from phone screening to technical interview and through to offer stage. 

#### Adaptable
During my time as a technical recruiter, I have worked in many different teams with a lot of different people. This has allowed me to become very adaptable in the way that I work. I am able to work outside of my comfort zone and learn how to work effectively in several different environments. I have worked with several different organisations, ranging from a start up with around 20 people, to a global technology consultancy.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2017 - March 2018)

I am a Fullstack Developer and was one of the first six to be offered a place on the Makers Academy Fellowship. Being at Makers Academy has reinforced my love for technology, shown me the benefits of modern Software Engineering processes as well as broadening my technical horizons and feeding my curiosity. 

I discovered my passion for the tech industry whilst I was a Technical Recruiter and this led me to begin to learn as much as I could about the IT industry through speaking with Engineers, attending meetups and discussing roles with clients. I then began to teach myself how to code, starting with Ruby, Javascript and a small amount of Java.

My technical curiosity has led me down several different paths, the most interesting being DevOps, Blockchain technologies and Node. 

- OOP, TDD, Clean Code
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine
